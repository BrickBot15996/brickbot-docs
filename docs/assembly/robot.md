# **Cum se concepe un robot?**

Coming soon...

<hr>

<!--
## **Începutul unui sezon**

- gather all ideas and try them out
- try to define every way of scoring by all possible DoFs and take them out 1 by 1
- determine if a small robot is worth the hassle
- determine if a game has defense
- focus on delivery time too
<hr>

## **Cum faci alegerile potrivite**

- parameters used to judge things:
  - reliability
  - speed
  - weight
  - current consumption
  - complexity
  - necessary precision to work
- better explain the part about tradeoffs and give a real example
- focus on simplicity again

Probably should add this to the end of the document
