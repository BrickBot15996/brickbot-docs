# **Cum îți faci robotul ușor de condus?**

<!--add a hyperlink to the section about driver practice-->

- driveability is very mechanically oriented
- add mechanical solutions to reduce manual adjustments by the driver (limit intake size, add guiding for specific game elements etc.)

<!--give FF intakes and PP pole guides as example-->

- do not add an excessive amount of DoFs that make controlling unintuitive
